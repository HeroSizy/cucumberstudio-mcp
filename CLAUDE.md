This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a CucumberStudio MCP (Model Context Protocol) project. MCP servers provide standardized interfaces for AI assistants to interact with external systems and data sources.

## Development Commands

*Note: Commands will be added once package.json and build system are established*

## Architecture

*Note: Architecture details will be documented as the codebase develops*

## MCP Server Development Notes

- MCP servers implement the Model Context Protocol specification
- Servers typically expose tools, resources, and prompts to MCP clients
- Common patterns include resource discovery, tool execution, and state management
- Follow MCP specification for proper server implementation
